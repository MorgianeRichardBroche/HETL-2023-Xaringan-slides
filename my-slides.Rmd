Aims at considering the .red[diversity of our learners] in the classroom.

Framework that provides multiple means of:

Engagement - encourages teachers to look for .blue[ways to motivate] students;

Representation - offering information in .blue[more than one format];

Action and expression - giving students .blue[more than one way to interact] with the material.

# Accessibility for STEM Subjects

Creating accessible STEM material

class: middle

# Writing Mathematics

* Many teaching staff use **LaTeX** to write course material

  * Typesetting system which is particularly efficient to write advanced mathematics;
  
  * Academics use LaTeX to write all their documents (papers, research grants, presentations);
  
  * Schools and departments often have their own templates for notes, tutorials, labs and exams.

```


```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='right', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/latex.jpg")
```

# Writing Mathematics

.left[
The problem with LaTeX ...
]

.right[... is that is generates PDF (great for printing) which are .red[not accessible]: 

not easily tagged;

incompatible with text-to-speech software;

cannot be dynamically modified by reader.

# Writing Mathematics

* Alternative: provide HTML formats (with Mathjax to render the maths) **in addition to PDF**.

* **Existing material** can be converted

  * Tools such as Pandoc and related packages;
  
  * .red[Do not work 100%];
  
  * Need .red[considerable time and effort] to fix content.
  
* Not a long-term solution!

---

# Writing Mathematics

* Alternatives to LaTeX for furture course material

  * Pandoc Markdown, RMarkdown and Bookdown;
  
  * Generates PDF as well as HTML files;
  
  * Mathematical objects are written in LaTeX.
  
* Academics need to be informed and trained.

# University of Aberdeen Project


**Student project 1**

* Tested and documented a range of conversion packages.

**Student project 2**

* Staff survey to collect user feedback on conversion solutions and use of alternative languages.

* Next step: collect student feedback on material produced.

Further info: see poster .green[Creating Accessible STEM Teaching and Learning Resources].

# University of Glasgow Project

**LaTeX** (with complicated stylesheets and packages) used very heavily in Maths department.

**Student project 1:**

* Created stylesheet and RMarkdown template to ‘match’ existing notes, tutorial sheets and feedback exercise sheets 

* Tested with screenreaders and BB Ally

**Student project 2:**

* Automated process by writing Powershell scripts to ‘find and replace’ syntax from LaTeX to RMarkdown.

# SMSN Collaboration

* Complex and technical problem with no straightforward solution!

* Aim: document existing solutions and their limitations, inform and train staff.

* Means:

  * Maintain a curated toolkit and add to our current bank of resources;

  * Continue to run training workshops aimed at lecturers teaching STEM subjects;

  * Support the development of a resilient community of teachers.

# Plans for the Toolkit

* Guidance documents

* Sample templates for alternative markup languages

* Training resources from workshops

* Alt text, Graphs and Diagrams

* Use of colour
